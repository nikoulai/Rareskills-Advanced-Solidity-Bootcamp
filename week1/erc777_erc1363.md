## ERC777:

### 1. Backward Compatibility

ERC777 is fully backward compatible with ERC20, meaning that any software interacting with ERC20 tokens can also interact with ERC777 tokens. This backward compatibility ensures that existing infrastructure remains functional while benefiting from the additional features of ERC777.

### 2. Hooks for Tokens

One of the key innovations of ERC777 is the introduction of hooks, specifically `tokensReceived` and `tokensToSend`. These hooks allow for more complex logic to be executed during token transfers, receipts, or burns. For example, a smart contract can be automatically notified when it receives tokens, enabling more advanced decentralized applications (dApps).

### 3. Operator Support

ERC777 introduces the concept of "operators," which are addresses authorized to manage tokens on behalf of another address. This feature can be used for transaction fees, third-party account recovery, or other scenarios requiring delegated control over tokens.

### 4. Simplified Logic via Atomic Transactions

Thanks to hooks, ERC777 enables more complex operations to be completed in a single transaction. This reduces the need for multiple transactions and approvals, minimizing the chances of errors and simplifying contract interactions.

### 5. No Approve Double-Spend Issue

ERC777 eliminates the well-known issue in ERC20 where the `approve` function could potentially lead to a double-spend attack if not handled carefully. This makes ERC777 a safer option in certain scenarios.

## Issues with ERC777

### 1. Reentrancy Attacks

The hooks in ERC777 can introduce reentrancy attacks if not implemented carefully. A notable example is the 2020 attack on the Uniswap-Lendf.Me protocol, where vulnerabilities related to reentrancy were exploited.

### 2. Adoption Challenges

Despite its features, ERC777 has not been widely adopted compared to ERC20. This lack of adoption means that fewer wallets and exchanges support ERC777, potentially limiting its utility.

### 3. Increased Complexity

The additional features of ERC777 make it more complex to implement and understand, which could lead to bugs or vulnerabilities if not handled carefully.

### 4. Higher Gas Costs

Due to its additional features and complexity, certain operations in ERC777 may result in higher gas costs compared to ERC20.

## ERC1363: Motivations and Problems Solved

### 1. Extended Spending Mechanism

ERC1363 is designed as an extension of ERC20, adding methods that allow tokens to be spent by another on-chain contract as part of the approval process. This enables "transfer and call" or "approve and call" mechanisms within a single transaction, streamlining operations.

### 2. Developer-Friendly and Improved Usability

By extending ERC20, ERC1363 makes it easier for developers to create applications where tokens can interact directly with smart contracts without requiring a two-step process. This improved usability allows developers to integrate ERC1363 into existing systems without adopting an entirely new standard.

### 3. Smart Contract Interactions

ERC1363 facilitates direct interactions with smart contracts, enabling use cases such as on-chain subscriptions, automatic fee payments, and more. The standard is particularly useful for dApps requiring more complex token interactions.

### 4. Fallback Functions

ERC1363 allows a receiving contract to implement a fallback function executed when tokens are sent to it, similar to Ether transactions. This feature is crucial for certain dApps that require automatic responses to incoming tokens.

### 5. Layer 2 and Cross-Chain Compatibility

Due to its extended functionality, ERC1363 could be more compatible with Layer 2 solutions or cross-chain bridges, although this depends on the specific implementation.

## Issues with ERC1363

### 1. Adoption Challenges

Like ERC777, ERC1363 suffers from a lack of widespread adoption compared to ERC20. The broader support for ERC20 means that projects using ERC1363 may face compatibility issues.

### 2. Added Complexity

While ERC1363 aims to simplify interactions, the additional methods can add complexity to smart contract development, potentially leading to bugs or vulnerabilities.

### 3. Potential for Confusion

Because ERC1363 extends ERC20, there might be confusion or compatibility issues when interacting with contracts expecting a plain ERC20 token. Contracts not updated to recognize ERC1363's additional methods could face compatibility problems.
