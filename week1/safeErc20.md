# SafeERC20:

## Purpose

In the standard ERC20 implementation, functions like `transfer` and `transferFrom` do not automatically revert on failure. Instead, they return a boolean value indicating whether the operation was successful. To handle potential failures, developers need to explicitly check this return value and revert the transaction if it indicates a failure.

However, some tokens, such as USDT and BNB, deviate from this standard. These tokens might always return `false` for certain operations, leading to unexpected behavior and potential issues in smart contracts.

**SafeERC20** is a library designed to address this issue. It wraps standard ERC20 functions and automatically reverts the transaction if the return value indicates failure, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of the token implementation.

## Best Use Cases

SafeERC20 should be utilized in contracts that interact with tokens potentially not adhering to the standard IERC20 return values. By using SafeERC20, developers can safeguard their contracts against irregular ERC20 implementations, reducing the risk of errors or protocol failures, and ensuring more reliable smart contract operations.
